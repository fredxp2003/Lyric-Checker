# Lyric-Checker

Thanks for checking out this program.  This was made in Python using the lyricsgenius module.

For a complete tutorial on how to use this program, go to https://fredxp2003.github.io

If you are running the code, not the executable, then you will need the following modules:
- lyricsgenius
- openpyxl
- pandas
- xlrd
- tkinter
- webbrowser

Feel free to fork this repository and add things.  Or submit a feature request and I'll try my best to add it.
